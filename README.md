# GraphForge

## Overview

**GraphForge** is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to provide users with a dynamic interface for querying and visualizing data in a graph format, similar to a Neo4j browser. It allows users to create and manage queries, view results, and explore data relationships in an intuitive way.

## Purpose

The primary goals of GraphForge are:

- **Interactivity**: Users can input queries directly into the app and receive immediate feedback in the form of results displayed dynamically on the screen.
- **Accessibility**: As a PWA, GraphForge can be accessed from any device with a web browser, providing a seamless experience across different platforms. Users can install the app on their devices, allowing them to use it offline and enhancing accessibility.
- **User-Friendly Design**: The app features a simple and clean layout with easy navigation, ensuring that users can efficiently find their way around the application.
- **Real-Time Updates**: With the integration of service workers, GraphForge can cache resources and manage background sync, providing users with the latest information without needing to refresh the page.

## Features

- **New Query Creation**: Users can easily add new queries and run them to explore different data sets.
- **Result Display**: Query results are displayed dynamically within the app, allowing users to see the relationships and details immediately.
- **Navigation**: The sidebar offers quick access to saved queries and settings, making it easy for users to manage their work.
